I want to create an iOS app called "Printer" to make printing, scanning, and copying documents more seamless for users. While iOS already allows document printing through the "Share" button and scanning via the "Notes" app, my app aims to consolidate these features into a single, user-friendly platform. "Printer" will automatically connect to available Wi-Fi printers and provide additional functionality, such as editing or annotating scanned documents before printing. Beyond basic tasks, the app will also offer a library of printable templates, including calendars, planners, wrapping paper, and lined paper, giving users creative and practical options. Unlike brand-specific apps like those from HP or Epson, "Printer" will work universally with multiple printer brands, focusing on simplicity and accessibility to make printing easier for all iOS users.
